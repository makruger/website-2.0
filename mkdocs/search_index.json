OpenIndiana and Illumos related?\n\n\nThe \nIllumos project\n is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports \nillumos-gate\n, the core software used by the OpenIndiana distribution.\nSimilar to a BSD \nsrc\n tree, illumos-gate includes the illumos kernel, along with many of the device drivers, core libraries, and system utilities.\n\n\nTo form a complete distribution, the OpenIndiana project combines illumos-gate with \noi-userland\n, and with other free and open-source software.\nThis melding of software from many different open-source projects is similar to how Linux distributions use the Linux kernel along with software from the GNU and various other open source projects.\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana differ from OpenSolaris?\n\n\nSome of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSun/Oracle's proprietary OS/NET consolidation has been replaced with \nillumos-gate\n.\n\n\nMany of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized into a single oi-userland consolidation.\n\n\nOracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler.\n\n\nXVM (XEN) has been replaced with the illumos-kvm port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster's transition from Sun Studio to GCC has resulted in a discontinuance of ABI (binary) compatibility with previous releases of OpenIndiana, Oracle Solaris, and OpenSolaris.\nApplications coded in the \nC\n language should continue to work normally.\nTherefore, this change only affects applications written in the \nC++\n language.\n\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana compare to BSD or Linux?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these operating systems follow the Unix paradigm and contain tools and commands which bear a similar resemblance, although specific feature sets and command usage may be dissimilar.\nIf you are coming to OpenIndiana from either BSD or Linux, you will quickly learn these differences.\nIn no time at all, you'll feel right at home working with OpenIndiana's tools and commands.\n\n\nWhat features does OpenIndiana have?\n\n\nOpenIndiana contains the following enterprise class features and more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZFS\n\n\nZFS File System and Volume Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTrace\n\n\nDynamic Tracing Framework - (System Introspection)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow\n\n\nNetwork Virtualization and Resource Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMF\n\n\nService Management Facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFMA\n\n\nFault Management Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMSTAR\n\n\nCommon Multiprotocol SCSI TARget - (ISCSI Target Framework)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKVM\n\n\nKernel Virtual Machine - (Operating System Virtualization)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZones\n\n\nOS Level Virtualized Application Containers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-Slider\n\n\nAutomated ZFS Snapshots and Rollbacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRBAC\n\n\nRole-Based Access Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPMP\n\n\nIP Network Multipathing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLMP\n\n\nData Link Multipathing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the OpenIndiana release schedule?\n\n\nApproximately every six months, the OpenIndiana project releases a snapshot of the Hipster rolling release branch.\nIdeally suited for both workstations and servers, simply choose the installer type which best serves your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n\n\nServer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive installer (Gnome desktop)\n\n\nText installer (command line console)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana releases from the legacy oi-dev-151x branch are no longer maintained.\n\n\nFor those desiring to upgrade from legacy installations, Hipster IPS repositories are available.\n\n\nWhile upgrades from the legacy branch are possible, the most trouble free method is to perform a clean install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nHipster is a rapid development branch where software versions are frequently updated.\nWhile every package is tested to ensure stability, caution is nevertheless warranted when deploying Hipster into mission critical production environments.\n\n\n\nWhat are the recommended hardware specifications?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nDisk Space\n\n\nMemory (RAM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64 Bit\n\n\n20GB (or more)\n\n\n4GB (or more)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes OpenIndiana support internationalization and localization?\n\n\nYes, when installing OpenIndiana, you may choose from 47 different keyboard layouts and 22 different languages.\n\n\nDoes OpenIndiana provide security and bug fixes?\n\n\nYes, absolutely.\nFor the actively maintained Hipster rolling release, the OpenIndiana project seeks to ensure all known flaws are quickly mitigated.\nFor this effort to succeed, we ask our user base to diligently bring security and bugfix concerns to our attention by submitting a ticket with the \nOpenIndiana Bug Tracker\n.\n\n\nWhere can I download OpenIndiana Hipster?\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Mirror\n\n\nVim.org Alternate Mirror\n\n\nTorrents\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to purchase a ready made DVD or USB drive there is also \nOSDISC.COM\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not yet support USB 3.0.\n\n\n\n\nWhen attaching backward compatible USB 3.0 devices to your system, please ensure they are \nNOT\n attached to a USB 3.0 port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAt this time, creating a bootable flash drive requires the use of a header file.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 unique USB header files (1G and 2G).\n\n\nPlease ensure you have selected the correct file.\n\n\nThe 1G.header is only suitable for use with the text installer (Command line console).\n\n\nThe 2G.header is only suitable for use with the live installer (Gnome desktop).\n\n\nThe files are \nNOT\n interchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to use the correct USB header file can result in the USB drive either failing to boot, or only partially booting (and falling back to systems maintenance mode with KSH93 errors).\n\n\n\nFor further information about how to create a bootable OpenIndiana flash drive, consult the \nOpenIndiana Handbook\n.\n\n\nWhat package manager does OpenIndiana use?\n\n\nOpenIndiana uses the network based \nImage Packaging System (IPS)\n.\nFor those coming to OpenIndiana from BSD or Linux, the IPS package manager will be an easy transition.\nYou may also continue to use the legacy \npkgadd/pkgrm\n commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe OpenIndiana distribution provides a basic set of packages, along with some extras.\nThere are also 3rd party repositories which provide additional packages.\nIf you wish to contribute by helping to expand package availability, please read further down about how to get involved with the OpenIndiana project.\n\n\n\nThe following IPS repositories are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository Name\n\n\nRepository

This is a more modern application than the old \"OpenSolaris Live USB creator\" utility. We'll need to test this to ensure this works with the OpenIndiana USB images.\n\n\nTesting Openindiana Using Live Media\n\n\nThe Live Media DVD and USB installers provide a graphical live environment where you can explore OpenIndiana and test the compatibility of your hardware.\nWhen using Live Media to explore OpenIndiana, no changes are made to your system, unless you explicitly choose to install OpenIndiana.\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to use it over a network with SSH X forwarding if you enable SSH.\n\n\nBooting OpenIndiana\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana does not yet support UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) or secure boot.\nThese technologies must be disabled prior to booting an OpenIndiana DVD or USB stick.\n\n\n\nBooting Physical Hardware\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert the bootable media (DVD or USB flash drive) and boot (start/restart) your computer.\nFor the computer to boot from the media, you may need to specify the device by pressing the boot order hotkey.\nAlternately, you may need to change the boot device order in your BIOS configuration.\n\n\nBooting Virtual Hardware\n\n\nThe most efficient way to boot a virtual machine is to boot directly from the DVD ISO file.\nAlternately, you may use host to guest DVD/USB passthrough to boot from physical media.\n\n\nVirtualbox\n\n\nFor VirtualBox 3.2 or later:\n\n\n\"Use host I/O cache\" must be enabled in the emulated storage controller used by the virtual machine to successfully boot OpenIndiana.\n\n\nVmware Workstation Player\n\n\n place holder for content \n\n\nVmware ESXI\n\n\n place holder for content \n\n\nThe OpenIndiana Boot Menu\n\n\nWhen you see a menu, press Enter to start OpenIndiana on your computer.\nAs it runs, you will be prompted with a few questions.\nYou should eventually be presented with a desktop.\n\n\nAuthenticating when using the OpenIndiana LiveDVD\n\n\nThe user login for the text session is username 'jack' along with the password 'jack'.\nFor administrative or elevated access, prepend your commands with \npfexec\n.\nYou may also use the \nsudo\n command.\n\n\nYou may obtain root using the \nsu\n command along with the password 'openindiana'.\n\n\nUsing the Device Driver Utility\n\n\nYou can use the Device Driver Utility to check if your hardware requires additional drivers.\n\n\nPreparing to Install OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place Holder for section introduction content \n\n\nBacking up data\n\n\n Place holder for content \n\n\nDeciding where to install OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place holder for content \n\n\nGathering Network Information\n\n\n Place holder for content \n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place Holder for content \n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana from Live Media\n\n\nTo install OpenIndiana from Live Media, you have two options.\n\n\n\n\nGUI based guided install.\n\n\nText based guided install.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these options is represented by a desktop icon.\nSelect the appropriate installer option by clicking the corresponding desktop installer icon.\n\n\nGUI based Guided Install\n\n\n Place Holder for Content \n\n\nText based Guided Install\n\n\nThe text based guided install start and runs within a command line console.\nNavigation within the installer is performed by pressing specifically designated navigation keys (F2, Tab, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe non-graphical text based bootable media installer also uses this very same \nText based Guided Install\n.\n\n\n\nStart the Text based Guided Install by double clicking the Text based Guided Install icon.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you begin the Text based Guided Install, you are presented with the welcome screen.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nThe installer identifies the disks which are available for installation.\nIf you have only a single disk, it is already selected.\nIf you have multiple disks, use the arrow keys to select the appropriate disk.\nWhen finished, press F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nDisregard the minimum and recommended sizes as they do not take into account periodic disk usage growth as the result of ZFS snapshots.\nTo account for this, your disk should be at least 25GB or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your disk contains a GPT disk label, the entire disk will be reformatted.\nThis warning serves as your advisory.\nIf this is acceptable, press F2 to continue.\nOtherwise use the arrow keys to select cancel.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you are presented with the choice of how to partition the disk.\nYou may select to use an EFI partition (which uses the entire disk), or you may choose to create MBR partitions.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate choice and press F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the computer name you wish to use.\nBy default the computer name is \nopenindiana\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis screen is the same as as the previous.\nWe have illustrated it twice to help clarify the 2 distinct configuration tasks which need to be completed on the screen.\n\n\nAfter configuring the computer name, now you need to decide whether to automatically configure networking (DHCP), or leave network unconfigured.\nUse the arrow keys to select your choice.\nPress the F2 key to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen (and the following 2 screens) you will configure your time zone.\nIf you select UTC/GMT, you will only be presented with this single screen.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate region.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the arrow keys, select your time zone location.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the arrow keys, select the appropriate time zone.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you may configure the date and time.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you are presented with several different fields to configure.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE\n\n\n\nThe regular user specified on this screen is granted the \nroot\n role.\nIn effect this means by default (and without any further configuration) this user can perform administrative task by assuming the root role as needed.\nAlso, after installation the root password is automatically expired and needs to be changed prior to being used for any administrative task.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have completed the installation configuration, you are presented with an \nInstallation Summary\n.\nIf these configuration settings are correct, begin the installation by pressing the F2 key.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation progress is measured by means of a status bar.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the installation completes you are presented with a summary screen.\nThe installation logs are available by pressing the F4 key.\nIf you ran the installation from Live Media, can exit the installation by pressing F9.\nOtherwise, you will want to reboot the system using the F8 key.\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nThe text installer is not graphical nor does not have a live environment.\nWhen you boot from the text installer, it immediately begins the installation process using the previously described \nText based Guided Install\n.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Installations\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see a menu after booting your computer with the DVD or USB device, and instead see some text and a \ngrub\n prompt, there may be an error in your copy of the installer, or it was created incorrectly.\n\n\nIf you see a \nlogin:\n prompt after selecting your keyboard and language and no desktop appears after several seconds, there may be a problem with the drivers for your graphics hardware.\n\n\nPlease let us know via IRC or the mailing list if this happens.\n\n\nWhen you contact us, please include any error messages you see on the console, as well as the output of the \nsvcs -xv\n command.\n\n\nIf possible, also include the contents of the file \n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB 3.0 issues\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not currently support USB3.\n\n\nYou cannot boot a USB thumbdrive installer from a USB3

This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release.\nThe proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\"\nDoc Team Notes:\n Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the \nprint-service\n command. Both \nlp\n and \nlpr\n are symbolically linked to \nprint-service\n. Issuing the command \nprint-service -q\n shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS.

Deprecation notes:  Subsequent to the release of OpenSolaris 2009.06, the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) was selected as the default print service, however, the lp print service was retained. This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release. The proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\" Doc Team Notes:  Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the  print-service  command. Both  lp  and  lpr  are symbolically linked to  print-service . Issuing the command  print-service -q  shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS. More information can be found in the print-service (1M) man page.

MDB also provides a powerful set of built-in commands that enable you to analyze the state of your program at the assembly language level.

Device Driver Tutorial also explains how device drivers work in the Solaris OS. This book is a companion to  Writing Device Drivers . Writing Device Drivers  is a thorough reference document that discusses many types of devices and drivers. Device Driver Tutorial examines complete drivers but does not provide a comprehensive treatment of all driver types. Device Driver Tutorial often points to Writing Device Drivers and other content for further information.    Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster  To be determined    Target Audience  You should read this tutorial if you need to develop, install, and configure device drivers for the Solaris OS. You also should read this book if you need to maintain existing drivers or add new functionality to existing Solaris OS drivers. Information about the kernel provided in this book also will help you troubleshoot any problems you might encounter installing or configuring Solaris systems.    Requirements  To write device drivers for the Solaris OS, you should have the following background: Be a confident C programmer Have experience with data structures, especially with linked lists Understand bit operations Understand indirect function calls Understand caching Understand multi-threading (see the Multi-threaded Programming Guide) Be familiar with a UNIX\u00ae shell Understand the basics of UNIX system and I/O architecture The most important information you need to have to write a device driver are the characteristics of the device. Get a detailed specification for the device you want to drive. Experience with Solaris OS compilers, debuggers, and other tools will be very helpful to you. You also need to understand where the file system fits with the kernel and the application layer. These topics are discussed in this tutorial.",
